# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. You will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

## Overview:
In this project, I was required to use my skills in debugging and problem-solving. I must say the challenge was quite easy, I managed to use the knowledge that I've gathered while studying JavaScript and I managed to complete it successfully. 

## Techonlogies used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

## feedback:
I enjoyed working on this project. Debugging is very nice!

## Challenges:
I experienced a challenge on room2, I had to add an async keyword and I added it on the wrong line of code. But I managed to fix that and now the code is funtional.

## Conclusion:
In this project I managed to use a different logic in the intersections part, I used a filter.

#### Debugging Tasks

1. **Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**
